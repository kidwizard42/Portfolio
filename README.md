My portfolio which contains my resume, a bio, and projects I've built
Welcome to my portfolio page! This website is to showcase my skills and to share a little bit about my self. I hope you enjoy your time here!

Major functions of the project and its layout will be described below (numbered)

1.The site has two pages, a home and a resume page. The home page contains a carousel an about me section and a way to connect with me through linked IN, github and email. The resume page is built off of how my regular resume is made. Both pages are responsive.

HOME PAGE 1. Carousel: You'll find an automatic carousel that cycles through projects I've done at the top of the page. It's made using a section tag that has an image of the project and text that describes the project. There are also buttons on the side that allow you to cycle through the projects yourself. On mobile the left arrow button is removed.

    2. About me: this section just gives people a little background about myself. On mobile the about me section just scrolls instead of extending the page length.

    3. Contact: Three icons that have links to github Linked IN and my email. Email link pops open a modal.

    4. Header: A header that links you to my resume page, about section, and contact section. On mobile the links are hidden and a hamburger is added. click the hamburger to see the links.

RESUME PAGE 1. A resume page that lists my skills, education, and relevant experience with projects that I built. Was built out completely through html (do not reccomend no need to do all that. ) and is responsive just like the home page.
